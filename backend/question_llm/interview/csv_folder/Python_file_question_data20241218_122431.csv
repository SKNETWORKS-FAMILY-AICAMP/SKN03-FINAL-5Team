What are the main limitations of using Python in embedded mode on mobile platforms, and how can they be overcome?","Python을 모바일 플랫폼에 임베디드 모드로 사용하는 것은 제가 직면했던 주요 과제 중 하나였습니다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해, 우선 Python을 모바일 앱에 통합하기 위한 Python 임베딩 API 사용에 집중했습니다. 특히, Android와 iOS에서의 차이를 이해하고 각 플랫폼에 맞는 최적화된 솔루션을 개발했습니다. Android에서는 제한적인 서브프로세스 지원 문제를 해결하기 위해 비동기 작업 및 쓰레딩을 활용했고, iOS에서는 시스템 자원 접근 제한을 극복하기 위해 플랫폼 특정 API를 사용했습니다. 이러한 노력의 결과로, 앱의 성능을 30% 향상시키고 사용자 경험을 크게 개선할 수 있었습니다. 앞으로 이 경험을 바탕으로 더욱 효율적인 모바일 앱 개발에 기여하고자 합니다.","Using Python in embedded mode on mobile platforms was one of the major challenges I faced. To address this issue, I focused on using the Python embedding API to integrate Python into mobile apps. Specifically, I worked on understanding the differences between Android and iOS and developed optimized solutions for each platform. On Android, I utilized asynchronous tasks and threading to address the issue of limited subprocess support, and on iOS, I used platform-specific APIs to overcome restrictions on accessing system resources. As a result of these efforts, I was able to improve the app's performance by 30% and greatly enhance the user experience. Moving forward, I aim to contribute to more efficient mobile app development based on this experience.","기술스택: Python

When developing a web application using Pyodide and PyScript, how did you implement interaction with JavaScript and the DOM API?","Pyodide와 PyScript를 사용하여 웹 애플리케이션을 개발할 때의 핵심 목표는 Python의 강력한 기능을 브라우저 환경에서 효율적으로 활용하는 것이었습니다. JavaScript와 DOM API와의 상호작용을 구현하는 데 있어서는 제한된 네트워킹 기능과 프로세스 제어가 없다는 점이 도전 과제였습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 JavaScript의 XMLHttpRequest와 Fetch API를 활용하여 브라우저와의 데이터 통신을 원활히 하였고, Pyodide의 DOM API 접근성을 최대한 활용하여 사용자 인터페이스를 구현했습니다. 이러한 접근 방식으로 인해 사용자 경험이 향상되었고, 성능 최적화도 달성할 수 있었습니다. 앞으로는 이러한 경험을 바탕으로 더 복잡한 웹 애플리케이션 개발에 기여할 수 있을 것으로 기대합니다.","The core goal when developing a web application using Pyodide and PyScript was to efficiently leverage Python's powerful features in a browser environment. A challenge was the limited networking capabilities and lack of process control when implementing interaction with JavaScript and the DOM API. To address this, I utilized JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API to facilitate smooth data communication with the browser, and maximized the accessibility of Pyodide's DOM API to implement the user interface. This approach enhanced the user experience and achieved performance optimization. Moving forward, I expect to contribute to the development of more complex web applications based on this experience.","of Python on WebAssembly platforms depend on theEmscripten-SDK orWASI-SDK version, WASM runtimes (browser, NodeJS,wasmtime), and Python build time flags. WebAssembly, Emscripten, and WASIare evolving standards; some features like networking may besupported in the future.For Python in the browser, users should considerPyodideorPyScript.PyScript is built on top of Pyodide, which itself is built on top ofCPython and Emscripten. Pyodide provides access to browsers’ JavaScript andDOM APIs as well as limited networking capabilities with JavaScript’sXMLHttpRequestandFetchAPIs.Process-related APIs are not available or always fail with an error.

It supports severaladvanced features not found in other implementations like stackless supportand a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourageexperimentation with the language itself by making it easier to modify theinterpreter (since it is written in Python).

Python을 사용하여 모바일 플랫폼(Android 및 iOS)에서의 애플리케이션 개발 시 고려해야 할 주요 차이점은 무엇인가요?," django, flask, node.js, react, fast_api, python","Question:
What are the key differences to consider when developing applications on mobile platforms (Android and iOS) using Python?","모바일 플랫폼에서 Python을 사용하여 애플리케이션을 개발할 때, 주요 차이점은 Python이 임베디드 모드에서만 사용 가능하다는 점입니다. 이를 해결하기 위해, Android와 iOS에서의 Python 임베딩 API를 활용하여 프로젝트를 진행했습니다. Android에서는 서브프로세스 생성이 가능하지만 비공식적으로 지원되지 않으며, iOS에서는 전혀 지원되지 않기 때문에 이 점을 고려하여 멀티프로세싱 없이 단일 프로세스로 동작하는 설계를 하였습니다. 이러한 제한사항에도 불구하고, Python의 장점을 최대한 살려 모바일 애플리케이션의 안정성과 성능을 최적화할 수 있었으며, 이는 사용자 리뷰에서 긍정적인 반응으로 이어졌습니다. 앞으로는 이러한 경험을 바탕으로 더 복잡한 시스템을 효과적으로 관리할 수 있는 방안을 연구하고, 모바일 플랫폼 간의 일관된 사용자 경험을 제공하는 데 기여하고자 합니다.","When developing applications using Python on mobile platforms, the main difference is that Python can only be used in an embedded mode. To address this, we utilized Python embedding APIs for both Android and iOS in our project. On Android, subprocess creation is possible but not officially supported, and on iOS, it is not supported at all. Therefore, we designed the application to operate as a single process without multiprocessing. Despite these limitations, we were able to optimize the stability and performance of the mobile application by leveraging Python's advantages, which resulted in positive feedback in user reviews. Moving forward, we aim to explore ways to manage more complex systems effectively based on this experience and contribute to providing a consistent user experience across mobile platforms.","기술스택: Python

The main challenges are the limited networking and process management capabilities in the browser environment. To address this, we maximized the accessibility of Pyodide's JavaScript and DOM APIs and devised a strategy to fetch necessary data using the Fetch API. These measures improved the performance of the browser-based application by 20% and increased the responsiveness of the user interface. In the future, we plan to track the advancements in WebAssembly to integrate more advanced features, thereby continuously improving the functionality and efficiency of the application.","of Python on WebAssembly platforms depend on theEmscripten-SDK orWASI-SDK version, WASM runtimes (browser, NodeJS,wasmtime), and Python build time flags.
